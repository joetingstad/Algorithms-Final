# Convex Hull Simulation - Final Project Eagles

## Goals
Analyze the performance of different convex hull algorithms (Quickhull, Graham scan, Gift Wrapping), Build visualizations for each of the convex hull algorithms we analyzed, andb uild a collision detection simulation (time permitting)

## Our project
We set out to analyze and display the differences between the convex hull algorithms. We did so using a simulation program that displays the process that each of the algorithms uses in finding the hull. We display the lines that form the hull as they change until we have the final result. We also intended to have a collision detection simulation that we were unable to complete.

Here is a link to our final presentation!

## Assumptions
We didn't have any real assumptions about our program, as it is only intended to help users understand the differences between the algorithms in a visual representation. As far as the representation of our algorithm, we assumed that users would be familiar with the concept of a convex hull algorithm.

## How To run it
All you need to run our program is a working version of matplotlib installed on python, and then just start the simulation the same way you start any python script
